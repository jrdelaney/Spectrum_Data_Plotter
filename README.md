# Spectrum_Data_Plotter
R Shiny App wrapper for common ggplot2 uses

To use standalone on your computer, please install R, Rstudio, and the R libraries noted within the ui.R and server.R files. If statistical comparisons are desired, use the app.R file. These .R files and the example data .csv file must be present in the same folder to function properly. Once installation is complete, the user can open any .R file and run Spectrum Data Plotter locally using the play button in Rstudio
